 # Welcome to WritingBuddy!

## Introduction

WritingBuddy is a program that, once complete, will allow users to create and edit text documents in the web browser in a distraction-free environment; make use of various writing aids such as font-size and colour-scheme adjustment; and receive feedback on grammar, readability, and quality. It consists of a **server** that provides a **single-page web application**.

This is an educational side project that is meant to cover a large amount of ground. It involves standard **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for users and their documents; it involves **full-stack** programming using the **MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, NodeJS)** stack; and it may grow to involve using a large amount of **algorithm engineering** and potentially **machine learning** to efficiently and effectively implement **search indexing**, **readability scores**, and **grammar checks**.

One purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of good software engineering principles. The "Design" folder includes a large number of files involved in designing the project, including design specifications and diagrams.
