 # Welcome to WritingBuddy!

## Introduction

WritingBuddy is a program that, once complete, will allow users to create and edit text documents in the web browser in a distraction-free environment; make use of various writing aids such as font-size and colour-scheme adjustment; and receive feedback on grammar, readability, and quality.

This is an educational side project that is meant to cover a large amount of ground. It involves standard **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for users and their documents; it involves **full-stack** programming using the **MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, NodeJS)** stack; and, once the grammar and readability components are done, it will involve a **machine learning** component as well.
